# 3D Modelling Project - Will's Memorial Building Geology Library

![Completed render of the library model](/TexturingAndLightingRender.jpeg)

### Summary

This is a 3D model of the geology library in Will’s Memorial Building, Bristol, which I created this over the course of several months for the Character and Set Design university module. I did a majority of the modelling work from within in the library itself; the lighting, texturing, and the remainder of the modelling were done from home using a series of reference photos.

The model itself was too large to include in this repository: I have included the final render 'TexturingAndLightingRender.jpg', alongside a series of images of the completed model.

I’m particularly proud of the hanging ceiling decorations, which match very closely to the real thing, and really help capture the essence of the room in the final render. I’m also very proud of the patterned wooden chair models; I had to draw from a wide variety of the techniques I had learned to recreate these as closely as possible, including a few I had to learn for that specific purpose.

The most challenging part was certainly the windows. I used Maya’s mathematical curve and surface modelling tools to try to capture the precise spiralling patterns, but found that the surfaces produced from the curves sometimes aligned poorly in unexpected ways, and attempting to manually correct this was very time-intensive.
